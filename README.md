# Web Programming With Go

This book will guide you through the process of building a complex web app with Go, similar to one you might build in other programming languages with Rails, Django or Flask. Readers coming from other languages or frameworks should not find it difficult to translate this knowledge to Go, but there is a dearth of examples of the details required to handle all the mundane activities of a web app - authentication, authorisation, templates, error handling, async operations etc.

### Assumptions

This is not an introductory guide to the Go language, so some prior knowledge of Go is required. You should first try the [Tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) at golang.org and read the [Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/) before starting. You should also have a working install of Go, and be familiar with concepts like the GOPATH before starting.

There are often arbitrary choices to be made \(for example about project layout, or which library to use\), and this book is not intended to be a prescriptive guide to the only way to produce Go applications. Suggestions for alternative approaches are welcome and _may_ be included in future editions.

The exercises in this book have been tested on Mac OS X and Linux.

### Code examples

All the code used in this guide is available here. You can fetch it with the command :

```
go get https://github.com/kennygrant/web-programming-with-go/examples
```

which will download the files to $GOPATH/src/github.com/kennygrant/web-programming-with-go/examples
